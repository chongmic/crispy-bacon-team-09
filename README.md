## What is JoyFill?
JoyFill is a social media application that allows students to share what brings them joy in their lives with their close friends. It is designed so that all aspects of the app can bring people together and create happier and more fulfilled lives in the real world.

## Who is JoyFill Meant For?
All university students! We hope that students will want to invest in each other's friendships and relationships and hope that they will spend more time living the highlights of their real world instead of viewing othersâ€™ posts on other mainstream social media platforms.
